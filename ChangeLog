I started this file to keep track of changes made in hybrid-6,
beginning with b37.  We are in VERY HIGH SPEED development mode,
so it's important to keep track of this. =)

[1] Added the following options:

	IDLE_IGNORE
		When used in conjunction with IDLE_CHECK will prevent the
	        server from idle'ing clients connected from the listed IP#s. 
	        This should probably be moved into a conf file entry at
	        some point in the future.
	
	SEND_FAKE_KILL_TO_CLIENT
		Make the client think it's being KILL'ed.  This was
		originally intended to prevent clients from reconnecting to
		the server after being dropped for idleness.  It can
		probably be used for other events too.  This really only
		works well if the client was compiled with
		QUIT_ON_OPERATOR_KILL which was mandatory policy on
		UMich.Edu hosts.

	LTRACE (Limited TRACE)
		Reports only link and oper traces even when O:line is
		active. Displays only Oper, Serv, Link, and Class reports
		even if the O-line is active.  Useful for just showing
		pertinent info of a specific server. Note however that if
		the target server is not running this option then you will
		still receive a normal trace output.  Defining this will
		remove "STATS p" funtionality since the two are basically
		redundant.

	LWALLOPS
		This is actually a compatibility command which really calls
		m_locops().

	STATS_NOTICE
		Notify opers on STATS request.  Some people find this
		invasive and with the STAT command on PACE throttle the
		server shouldn't suffer but lusers stat for different
		reasons and many times it's been a prelude to some other
		form of attack.  Wrestle with your own morals before
		defining.

	SHOW_FAILED_OPER_ID
		If FAILED_OPER_NOTICE is defined, also notify when a client
		fails to oper because of a identity mismatch (wrong host or
		nick)

	SHOW_FAILED_OPER_PASSWD
		If FAILED_OPER_NOTICE is defined, also show the attempted
		passwd.  Once again, this may be morally offensive.

	WINTRHAWK
		Enable WintrHawk's style of reporting things.  This is most
		evident in TRACE and LTRACE which won't report idletimes
		otherwise.


[2] Bugfixes/changes:

	Fixed *_WHEN_SPLIT bug whereby a server was still considered split
	even though the network had reached SPLIT_SMALLNET_SIZE (but hadn't
	yet surpassed it).

	Added capability for defining OPER_UMODES, LOCOP_UMODES, and
	DEFAULT_SERVER_SPLIT_RECOVERY_TIME from config.h.

	Fixed m_trace() so that it now reports correct idletimes and added
	WINTRHAWK styling option.

	Updated opers.txt with mod1 commands.

	Added a ChangeLog |8^)

	Added some code for K-line files but it's not yet functional
