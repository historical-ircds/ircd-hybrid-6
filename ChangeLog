I started this file to keep track of changes made in hybrid-6,
beginning with b37.  We are in VERY HIGH SPEED development mode,
so it's important to keep track of this. =)

version hybrid-6-b37	13-Jan-1999

* removed M: line port & address activation on startup
  you *must* use at least one P: line in your config file now -- FlashMan
* completely rewrote get_client_name() to clean up the conditionals mess
  makes things look prettier overall -- FlashMan
* RPL_YOURHOST is now given to the client as server_name[sockhost/port]
  that the client connected to -- for virtual addresses and such -- FlashMan
* Removed SHOW_UH define from config.h -- no longer needed -- FlashMan
