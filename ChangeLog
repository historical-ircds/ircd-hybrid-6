  Log:
  - Change to ircsprintf().  Someone please look into this, as the change
  may affect daemon performance.  Here are the details:
  
  On RedHat Linux 7.1, gcc 2.96 seems to complain about trying to obtain
  the "address of a register" (in this case, args) in reference to the
  va_start() macro:
  
  "warning: address of register variable `args' requested"
  
  One can't get the _address_ of a CPU register, but I'm not sure if this
  is actually what's going on (due to va_start() being wacky as hell).
  
  This works on gcc 2.95.3 (FreeBSD 4.4-STABLE), though.  I have no idea if
  it's _ACTUALLY_ using a register or not.  Someone with gdb/gas knowledge
  should attempt to figure out what the heck is going on.

Lee is right. /stats j should be /stats q like hybrid-7. done deal.

- since the old code did a ++addr_count then compared to RES_MAXADDRS,
  it would not find any ip's, depending on the compilers interpretation
  of sequence points. Its quite possible, it would have resolved on sunpro
  compiler, but it sure does not on freebsd gcc.

- cleaned up formatting in res.c so I could follow the logic, still
  havent' found the bug

- cleaned up formatting in dbuf.c



*** 20011011_1 by db
We have to have to have to make sure the config.h is sane, EFNet admins are
lazy.



*** 20011008_4 by lusky
- revved patchlevel to 6.2.1rc1
- gutted the internal dns cache, BIND does a better job

*** 20010810_1 by leeh
- wrapped TS5 in #ifdef's
  I need to add doc/ts5.txt later


*** 20010806_2 by leeh
- added a special case exception for juped channels.
  if the channel is juped, and has no users, always use the incoming TS,
  even if its older, else if a channel is juped on a hub, youll get a TS
  desync


*** 20010806_1 by wcampbel
Corrected typos (from dracus)


*** 20010805_9 by db

*** 20010805_1 by leeh
- removed some #if 0'd code that doesnt need to be there


*** 20010804_2 by leeh
- changed some defaults


*** 20010804_1 by leeh
- we are now TS5
- added a doc describing the protocol changes
- TS5 will do the following:
  - TS rules are *always* obeyed, whether the channel is opless or not,
    whereas TS3 would allow ops from a channel merge on an opless channel,
    TS5 will NOT do this, the oldest channel will always win
  - this behaviour is NOT a define, we cant support backward compatibility
    now, so supporting it 6 months on doesnt make sense


*** 20010803_1 by leeh
- extended the check in get_client_name to cover handshaking/connecting
  servers


*** 20010731_1 by lusky
test commit to new repository

- src/s_serv.c: show_capabilities():
    Removed the trailing space during link-time or anything involving
    listing capabilities.  Also added error check for links without
    caps.


*** 20010726_2 by leeh
- added #define HIDE_ERROR_MESSAGES, as when we receive an error from a 
  server, theyll sometimes send their IP along with it..


*** 20010726_1 by leeh
- backport from -7
  if someone squits *us*, use cptr->name, not cptr->host


*** 20010722_2 by db
- Don't show ip's on auto conns



*** 20010722_1 by db
*sigh*
1) NO_HACK_OPS is broken atm, all servers in the network have to
   run this, or servers have to send deops, else you get desyncs.
   I'll look at this some more later.
2) Don't allow opers to gain ops on splits ever (for now, other networks
   might wish to allow this) But allow opers to join channels on splits.



*** 20010721_2 by leeh
- disable IP connects if hide servers ips is defined.. 

  we should *not* need to be protecting people from their own opers..
  ergo: this sucks.

*** 20010701_3 by greg
Barring any (more) hugeass bugs floating our way........

We are slowly inching closer to a 6.1 release.

- is -> larne in Hybrid-team;
- patchlevel is now b3;
- m_info is now a little less \n ridden for non-opers, and has a header
  for the compile options section
- tinkered in version.c.SH
- made /info look prett(y/ier)


*** 20010701_2 by greg
Commiting the equivalent of what I backed out, without the static
change that fucked up the entire tree.

Question, does this mean we'll now send back 'invalid mode char', to +d's?


*** 20010701_1 by greg
Backing out a commit for +d, it borked the -6 tree.


*** 20010630_2 by greg
Hi.

m_kill.c	- slight typo in the SERVERHIDE code. resulted in locals
		being "Killed (nick): reason", while remotes were
		"Killer (nick (reason))" .. that's bad.
s_user.c	- modified the nick collide code to, instead of doing a
		get_client_name in the resulting kills at all, just use
		cptr->name


*** 20010626_1 by db
- removed +d/-d channel mode, somehow this crept back in.
- re-formatted code



*** 20010624_7 by db
- allow opers to see ip's of clients on /trace so tcm's will work again
  do not allow them to see IP's of hidden clients



*** 20010624_6 by greg

*** 20010624_5 by greg
- turning _BACK_ config.h level *glare*


*** 20010624_4 by greg

- revving config.h level


*** 20010624_3 by greg
- removed bogus if statement
- damn style nazis
- now show clients ip to registered clients instead of 255.255.255.255 in 
  closing link notice
- you are the closing link, goodbye


*** 20010624_2 by db
- removed SEPARATE_KLINES_BY_DATE no one ever used it. 



*** 20010624_1 by db
- upped config.h level from6 to 6.1 CONFIG_H_LEVEL_6_1
  there are enough differences



*** 20010620_1 by db
- umm just a bit too severe on the IP hiding, showing 255.255.255.255
  for everything breaks vbots on tcm's.



*** 20010619_5 by leeh
- added NO_FAKE_GLINES, to stop spoofed glines
- heavy work on mo_gline(), not checking remote glines for invalid chars,
  or even for how many wildcard strings they have is *bad* so I added
  invalid_gline() and invalid_wildcard()

  the code is a bit messy.. someone should audit this


*** 20010619_4 by wcampbel
Added a blank line at the bottom to attempt to correct the permissions


*** 20010619_3 by wcampbel
Oops, reference to modules removed.


*** 20010619_2 by wcampbel

randomly generated salt)


*** 20010618_1 by db
- missing arg to #ifndef HIDE_SERVERS_IPS



*** 20010617_5 by db
- default to HIDE_SERVERS_IPS on



*** 20010617_4 by db
- upped patchlevel to 6.1b2



*** 20010617_3 by db
- backwards #ifndef's give me a headache, besides the rest of the code
  uses #ifdef HIDE_SERVERS IPS



*** 20010617_2 by greg
This morning on my way to coburg and with and archived copy of CVS source for
hybrid 6 taken last night at about midnight, I did the following. If I remember,
I'll check for updates to any files which I have audited for server IP leakage
when I get back, if not I'm not responsible for any changes made to the files
which I commit after last night. (I'll check again before we go release)

I did the following:
- s_misc.c	appears already audited, verified all get_client_name calls
- s_bsd.c	same as above, also corrected a few spacing errors to make our
		server messages a little cleaner
- s_auth.c	some report_error calls will leak ips, but if we do call this
		there should be a large enough amount of other ips which we're
		reporting an error for that the server one will go unnoticed,
		and there would be nothing to say this was a server, anyways.
- send.c	already audited
- m_trace.c	already audited
		also made it so that if we don't define SPOOF_NOTICE, ips are
		truly spoofed -- even for opers doing the request
- m_stats.c	already audited
- m_trace.c	already audited, fixed SPOOF_NOTICE stuff as well
- m_ltrace.c	already audited, fixed sPOOF_NOTICE stuff as well
- m_rehash.c	added perm. check for tklines and glines, cleaned up ugly code
- m_svinfo.c	already audited, we won't leak ip's for ts delta .. unlike what
		i thought
- m_squit.c	already audited
- m_server.c	.. _HIDE_SERVERS_IPS -> HIDE_SERVERS_IPS
		- some weird condition where a user sends a SERVER command was
		calling get_client_name twice in the same call .. mmm staticy
		goodness
- m_restart.c	no leakage .. i'm going to go modify the restart process to
		send the "Aieee!!!" message again, we changed it so that that
		doesn't get sent anymore, which is bad for people who wonder
		where their server went
- m_kline.c	some typos
- client.c/channel.c
		modified some words and typos and such

It looks like a lot, but it really isn't that much.

Pending any really huge bugs which haven't yet been found, and pending a
review of the HIDE_SERVERS_IPS bit and the rest of the modifications I made,
I think we're about ready to roll out a release?


*** 20010617_1 by kreator
- fix those mmap() tests and use ones that autoconf provides


*** 20010616_5 by db
- ok fixed a "dropped c line" bug. the problem was, both the hostname
  and servername have to match in attach_cn_lines, thats because
  you could have two servers on the same ip with different server names
- also fixed a minor typo here and there



*** 20010616_4 by leeh
- *ug*
  I think this catches all of the remaining get_client_name()'s.. 
  it still needs auditing though in case ive missed a few..

  I hope there arent this many in the -7 tree too :(


*** 20010616_3 by greg
It's 3am, and I've been up so long my tummy is growling.

- audited s_user.c and s_serv.c for get_client_name() calls which could
  give away a servers ip. if i saw one, i surrounded it with ifdefs for the
  hide_server_ips code, and masked it. enjoy.

to be done: s_{bsd,auth,misc,..} ok. on the other hand.

to be done: a lot of files should be audited for this.
            just doing a grep for get_client_name shows some calls on sptr's
            with TRUE/FALSE instead of MASK_IP


*** 20010616_1 by db
- missing a newts = oldts; in the bogus ts ignore code



*** 20010613_5 by leeh
- more fixes to HIDE_SERVERS_IPS


*** 20010613_4 by jdc

*** 20010611_3 by greg
check if the pid we read from PPATH is ourselves .. handles /restarts.

(thanks for pointing this out goes to Walter)


*** 20010611_2 by leeh
- do CHANMODE_E a different way.. we can *always* support them, just 
  ignoring clients doing mode +e, (not -e) and exempts on join..


*** 20010611_1 by leeh
- moved the "not approved on efnet section" up to where people
  will actually see it.. it was ok when it was just glines, but its
  grown significantly..
- moved LITTLE_I_LINES out of not-on-efnet section, I dont really think
  its a problem, and its a local decision anyway really


*** 20010610_2 by kreator
- added /usr/pkg and /usr/local paths for openssl detection since i have
  systems with those paths used for ssl - NetBSD, etc.


*** 20010610_1 by db
- moved LITTLE_I_LINES into "not supported" section *sigh*



*** 20010609_5 by db
- #ifdef'ed out features not approved on EFNet KNOCK and +e *sigh*



*** 20010609_4 by db

  configure


*** 20010606_10 by jdc

patches from Walter Campbell

1.  Added myself to the credits
2.  Put MAX_BUFFER under __CYGWIN__ control, and upped the values to a
    reasonable number
3.  Set INIT_MAXCLIENTS to 180, as HARD_FDLIMIT_(256) - 10 - MAX_BUFFER(60)
    is less than the original INIT_MAXCLIENTS(200).  180 is a better value
    With the default values, the true max connections can be 186 (44 on
    Cygwin).
4.  Fixed the path on FNAME_*LOG, someone committed a config.h with an
    inconsistant path
5.  Cleaned up many documentation entries in config.h
6.  With the addition of STATS_P_NOTICE, we now disable STATS_NOTICE by
    default, it resolves a major privacy issue.
7.  Some defines got flipped from previous versions, fixed
8.  Fixed LINKS in SERVERHIDE mode to show everything connected to the
    server you are connected to, as opposed to showing it connected to the
    network description.  We do NOT want to break clients too much!
9.  STATS v should be oper only, especially in SERVERHIDE
10. STATS q should give a correct error message
11. make clean in tools/ needs to remove encspeed
12. Spell checked all the docs
13. Synced up mkpasswd with my latest version (MD5 support, cleanly compiles
    on Solaris)
14. Backported the updated CIDR.txt, Riedel's operguide, and ejb's manpage
15. Updated certain values in config.h as per ievil's recommendations
16. Install the manpage into the DPATH directory, read with 'man -M . ircd'
17. Added a Y: line reference guide
18. Misc doc cleanup all around



*** 20010605_1 by kreator

*** 20010604_5 by db
- There is a reason we don't use if(foo) { 



*** 20010604_4 by db
- KNF != ircd



*** 20010604_3 by db
Patch from Walter Campbell

Not sure if you want this or not...I personally want this in the stock
Hybrid 6 tree...

1.  Remove the useless STATS b, e, and f requests
2.  Add STATS_P_NOTICE, so that admins do not have to #define
    STATS_NOTICE just to see STATS p requests.  I believe that this
    preserves user's privacy, while still giving opers the ability to
    respond to user's queries for help.




*** 20010604_2 by db
- argh I did miss one!



*** 20010604_1 by db
- well. folded in ircd-hybrid-6.0.2-enclinks3.tar.gz patches from
  einride@einride.net.  It compiles at least.
 


*** 20010603_9 by greg
Chances are you're going to hate me for these mods, but so be it!

- documented SPOOF_FREEFORM
  everyone knows this thing exists, and there's no use hiding it, as anyone
  who wants it either has a friend who knows, or can grep.
- adjusted SPOOF_NOTICE to also hide spoofed ilines in /stats I for opers
  as well, working under the assumption that if we don't went people to see
  the spoof notice, we don't want them to see the spoof either
- added TRUE_NO_OPER_FLOOD, again, another hate-me thing. this extends
  NO_OPER_FLOOD to not even delaying an opers flooding, a-la -comstud


*** 20010603_8 by greg
*Throws a bracket at Diane*


*** 20010603_7 by greg
Some trivial, some not so trivial.

- make n/N show up in /stats p even if not in O line
- add more info to umode +x server intro. msg
- add server split notices to umode +x (a-la +ins patch)


*** 20010603_6 by db
- don't show spoofs even to opers if SPOOF_NOTICE is not set



*** 20010603_5 by db
- backported A1kmm's patch to fix tsinfo



*** 20010603_4 by greg
Silly stupid annoying lame bug.

If an oper (or a client with a presumably large sendq, or something) sent
a large amount of data to the server which was not instantaneously parsed
(ie, their recvQ size broke 4088) the server encountered a deadlock-ish 
condition and never added their fd back to the read select mask. 

I kinda wonder who put that magic number there, but I'm not going to dwell
on it.

Evil bug, you go squish now.


*** 20010603_3 by db

1999/07/10 (tomh) - Changed unsigned long to unsigned int in client struct for rollups. See the - comment and associated test file in test for my rationale. The code that - calculates traffic density needs to be gone over and cleaned up, perhaps the - calculations should use another set of variables for this. I don't know if - using the client rollups is entirely suitable for the purpose, perhaps a - refreshed average (a vector of the last 5) would be better.

1999/07/09 (tomh) - fixed performance bug in cache expire

1999/07/08 (db) - removed USE_VARARGS (Sidewnder) 
1999/07/08 (db) - put me out to pasture. tables are used. duh. backed out last change

1999/07/08 (db) - neph's patch for [O] [o] and oper privs

1999/07/07 (db) - fixed two problems with auth code in s_bsd.c fd == -1 cores server - added /msg opers@server.name for messaging all opers at once -   needs better formatting. Perhaps should be restricted to opers only?

1999/07/04 (db) - fixed stupid typos in s_conf.c 
1999/07/04 (db) - added D and R flags in oper flags of port of O line, for /rehash and /die -   /restart is considered a form of /die and needs same privs

1999/07/01 (db) - bunch of changes to get rid of global m_set options, and put them -   all into one structure. I've been meaning to do this for months. - rewrote how fdlist's work, still needs more testing, but appears -   to be major win in CPU. Consider building up the FD_SET for -   default_fdlist and simply using that FD_SET in select() (similar for POLL) -   then the select() loop becomes a memcpy() of default_fdlist FD_SET -   this would also imply dns/ident fd's enter and leave the default_fdlist - removed the dup2 loop that was being used to "keep local[] filled at bottom" -   I thought I removed this already. dup in a loop is going to be an -   expensive sys call, I don't think its worth the bother, especially on -   a bigger server. 
1999/06/30 (db) - removed unnecessary include of fdlist.h in m_gline.c m_kline.c - removed global definition of add_gline() in h.h 
1999/06/29 (tomh) - cleaned up attach_iline a bit 
1999/06/29 (db) - finished slowaris's mods, removing obsolete bot checks, cleaned up a lot - re-arranged order of privmsg testing, slightly optimized for channel -   check with first char &# this will favour channel privmsgs over client 
1999/06/29 (db) - check for valid alphanum as first char of username 
1999/06/29 (db) - botrject only needs one argument now. functionality of gcos botcheck -   can mostly be done in X lines anyway. "X:/msg*hello:eggdrop" 
1999/06/28 (db) - Removed some obsolete bot checking - Moved privmsg to check channel first then nicks, since most privmsgs -   are to channels. - done by rjp (Slowaris) 
1999/06/28 (db) - Found serious stupid bug in m_gline.c - Encapsulated as much as possible of gline code into one file 
1999/06/27 (tomh) - removed sock.h from dependency list 
1999/06/27 (tomh) - removed empty unused header

1999/06/26 (db) - removed more "noise" from config.h - removed IDENTD_COMPLAIN completely, as same functionality can be -   done with I line flags now - simplified rights test in m_kline() - ensure local ops don't get the priv flags in port field they shouldn't 
1999/06/26 (db) - oops. 
1999/06/26 (db) - more cleanups in ... you got it s_user.c - removed some dead defines in config.h - added max reject held client counters - make sure numeric.h has definitions for now removed defines 
1999/06/26 (db) - found one aconf->name instead of aconf->user in m_kline.c this broke klines - testline was reporting ->name instead of user for K lines 
1999/06/26 (db) - Yet more s_user.c cleanup blech. will it ever end? 
1999/06/26 (db) - Still more cleanups to s_user.c register_user() getting there... 
1999/06/26 (db) - Even more clean up in s_user.c register_user 
1999/06/26 (db) - Added two missing includes to make it compile.

version hybrid-6-b60   29-Apr-1999
* if server split time is 0, i.e. split code is disabled, dont'
  put the server into split mode, this can leave 0 member channels
  lying around after a split.
* recoded NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT, all cleaned up.	 
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b59   17-Apr-1999
* missing ac2ptr_is_NULL check in m_ltrace
-Rodder
* if client is being spoofed in I line, don't show real IP to non opers
  in trace or stats L
* consistently use 127.0.0.1 for spoofed/oper ip's	
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b58   17-Apr-1999
* SOLARIS7 64bit USERS: this code appears to tickle a bug in gcc and egcs
  ONLY on 64-bit Solaris7.  You must compile on a 32bit kernel, then you
  can run the ircd binary on 32bit or 64bit.  Or reinstall your ircd
  machine as 32bit.  Or buy SunPro C.
* Created NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT_SIMPLE.  Totally disables the JOIN command
  for non-opers while split.  Doesn't care if the channel existed "before"
  or not.
* server notices are sent to +s clients when entering or leaving "split-mode"
-Rodder

version hybrid-6-b57   28-Mar-1999
* integrated ChangeLog with README.hybrid
* updated Hybrid-team and version.c.SH to reflect the current core team

* updated all Makefiles with new makedepend info    
* massive cleaning of the doc subdir
* changed defaults in config.h for public consumption

* added a couple of ifdefs to help compile under cygwin32b20.1
* added simple.conf to doc directory
* fixed rcs_version string in mtrie_conf.c and s_debug.c
* added SPLIT_PONG...  sends a PING at the end of m_server_estab(),
  checks for PONG from a server before resetting server_was_split.
* commented out malloc-2.6.1 in Makefile.in.  There is a doublefree
  somewhere, which most system mallocs can handle, but this one can't.
* updated m_info in s_serv.c to include all the new defines in config.h
-Rodder
* fixed mtrie_conf.c kline code
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b54   23-Mar-1999
* rewrote kline code (mtrie_conf.c), no more reverse, its faster now
  and ... works
* no more arbritray spoofs. too many complaints, it spoofs as 
  oper.server.name now
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b54   19-Mar-1999

in s_serv.c s_user.c
-Dianora
* optimization in can_send() in channel.c
-orabidoo

* added ip to /trace (help with virtual host cloners)
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b51   11-Mar-1999
* added WHOIS_WAIT to info output 
-Rodder
* was using idented username instead of ~ name for unidented clients
  caused weird bug. s_conf.c attach_Iline()
* clients with > I line were still being limited by client per IP limits.
* had BUFSIZ instead of BUFSIZE in strncpy() in s_serv.c broke m_unkline
* fixed "Bad Nick" problem. was harmless but stupid. users who used
  a nick beginning with '~' would trigger this one. Had Q line code in
  slightly wrong place. s_user.c m_nick()
* fixed truncation for username, affects k-lines both unidented, idented.
  s_user.c register_user()
* Added sendto_realops notification of spoofed IP's. should be SYSLOG
  or logged, for proper backtracking if necessary IMO
* fixed CLUSTER code, still needs thorough testing. s_serv.c send.c
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b50   24-Feb-1999
* report_specials was showing aconf->host not aconf->user
* return ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS if privmsg is used with multiple targets

is running this one oops.

version hybrid-6-b46   15-Feb-1999
* put fdlist code back in. Ok, I goofed. mea culpa.
* #ifdef USE_SYSLOG missing in ircd.c
* Ultrix'ed the Makefile.in as per Ian
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b46   15-Feb-1999
* FAST_FD_ISSET was causing the high CPU, *sigh* ok ripped out for now
* Fixed buffer overflow problem in m_unkline() s_serv.c, if a long long
  kline was in the kline.conf file, it cored the server. (reported by Phisher)
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b45    9-Feb-1999
* may as well use the same numeric for not being able to join a channel
  as ircnet uses changes to channel.c, s_err.c, s_err.h, numeric.h
* added small net user count to split end detection
* removed lame sleep()
* try non blocking reads of all connected servers, local opers
 then read_message()
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b44    2-Feb-1999
* remove trailing white space on H/L lines (just for Gersh)
* (s_bsd.c) fixed a botch with rr = 0 causing bizarre behaviour under solaris
  (ping time outs etc.) due to a mis-cut and paste from the select code
* (s_bsd.c) redid read_packet() to use msg_ready again
* (s_bsd.c) removed unnecessary default_read_set default_write_set, that was a
  remnant from a failed experiment with pre-set up fd set's, it was
  just slowing down the code for no reason.
* (s_misc.c) redid get_client_name() slightly to be consistent,
  idented names should not have ~ non-idented names should have ~
  lets not be inconsistent with (+) prefixes for idented names
-Dianora
* changed example.conf to remind people to have their virtual address in
  the M: line for outbound connects
* fixed the STATS_NOTICE invalid directive.  made it #define by default.
-FlashMan
* channel has to be +ip to show invite notices "p is for paranoid
  and thats good enough for me" too many complaints. I think this
  is a reasonable way of doing it for now.
* s_bsd.c moved some code around in in connect_inet() to remove
  a redundant if(specific_virtual_host). Also moved the error check
  on socket open logically where it should be.
* fixed the USE_FAST_FD_ISSET botch I introduced, corrected an unforseen
  error thats been there for a while.
* added a little more useful information in the bug report in blalloc.c
  I added a report of what size of block is being freed.
* I added a horrible kludge to ircd.c/struct.h to bit mark clients
  that have already been exited. It appears that somehow, the same
  client is being examined twice and exited twice =occasionally=
  Because of the block allocator, its safe to check the bit after free
  *kludge* I really didn't want to admit I coded that.
* Don't allow non local opers to see spoofed I lines. 
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b43    24-Jan-1999
* reworked io_loop dropping CPU load significantly, this is still something 
  that needs to be looked at.
* allow stats p even if LTRACE is defined, its habit for users even if
  it is redundant.
* I liked WINTRHAWK RPL_TRACESERVER report, so thats now the default.
* Added a test in DEBUGMODE to ensure fd == 2 was never read. This
  won't happen with select() read, but can if read_messages is
  called directly. Might as well be paranoid about it now. This one
  caused ircd to abort when compiled with DEBUGMODE in b42
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b42    24-Jan-1999
* removed [IP] being sent in CONNECT in connect burst
* removed [IP] if seen in m_links from prying eyes of users
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b41    23-Jan-1999
* removed USERNAMES_IN_TRACE default is always on now
* get_client_name() will default to sptr->username if sptr->user->username
  is null
* made config.h/config.h.dist consistent again, went back to stock defaults
-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b40    21-Jan-1999
* redid m_invite for better sanity testing, you can no longer
  invite users to a non-existent channel for example.
* Don't send SJOIN's for zero length MODE_SPLIT channels (Mortiis)
* redid m_sjoin for MODE_SPLIT channels treat it as a brand new channel
* fixed broken NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT to only care about channels that had
  existed before a split

-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b39    20-Jan-1999
* sanity test m_gline parc argument count, older hybrid-5 servers
  with buggy GLINE can core new hybrid-6 correct GLINE code 
* Forward the GLINE even if GLINE is not defined on this server.
  No point having GLINE for opers on a HUB for example, and servers
  that wish to opt out of others placing GLINE's can still relay it.
* keep a link list of 0 member channels created on a split
  if PRESERVE_CHANNEL_ON_SPLIT or NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT is defined
  remove all 0 member channels when split heals
  redid NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT to only care about channels that once existed.

-Dianora

version hybrid-6-b38    20-Jan-1999

* bumped version up to b38
* fixed bugs with "reason" code in ircd.c
* duplicated config.h to config.h.dist
* fixed bug in ircd.c with SEND_FAKE_KILL_TO_CLIENT
  if IDLE_CHECK not defined
* Added new defines to m_info() in s_serv.c
* Started adding code to deal with user@IP I lines to s_conf.c

-Dianora

* b37mod1

[1] Added the following options:

	IDLE_IGNORE
		When used in conjunction with IDLE_CHECK will prevent the
	        server from idle'ing clients connected from the listed IP#s. 
	        This should probably be moved into a conf file entry at
	        some point in the future.
	
	SEND_FAKE_KILL_TO_CLIENT
		Make the client think it's being KILL'ed.  This was
		originally intended to prevent clients from reconnecting to
		the server after being dropped for idleness.  It can
		probably be used for other events too.  This really only
		works well if the client was compiled with
		QUIT_ON_OPERATOR_KILL which was mandatory policy on
		UMich.Edu hosts.

	LTRACE (Limited TRACE)
		Reports only link and oper traces even when O:line is
		active. Displays only Oper, Serv, Link, and Class reports
		even if the O-line is active.  Useful for just showing
		pertinent info of a specific server. Note however that if
		the target server is not running this option then you will
		still receive a normal trace output.  Defining this will
		remove "STATS p" funtionality since the two are basically
		redundant.

	LWALLOPS
		This is actually a compatibility command which really calls
		m_locops().

	STATS_NOTICE
		Notify opers on STATS request.  Some people find this
		invasive and with the STAT command on PACE throttle the
		server shouldn't suffer but lusers stat for different
		reasons and many times it's been a prelude to some other
		form of attack.  Wrestle with your own morals before
		defining.

	SHOW_FAILED_OPER_ID
		If FAILED_OPER_NOTICE is defined, also notify when a client
		fails to oper because of a identity mismatch (wrong host or
		nick)

	SHOW_FAILED_OPER_PASSWD
		If FAILED_OPER_NOTICE is defined, also show the attempted
		passwd.  Once again, this may be morally offensive.

	WINTRHAWK
		Enable WintrHawk's style of reporting things.  This is most
		evident in TRACE and LTRACE which won't report idletimes
		otherwise.


[2] Bugfixes/changes:

	Fixed *_WHEN_SPLIT bug whereby a server was still considered split
	even though the network had reached SPLIT_SMALLNET_SIZE (but hadn't
	yet surpassed it).

	Added capability for defining OPER_UMODES, LOCOP_UMODES, and
	DEFAULT_SERVER_SPLIT_RECOVERY_TIME from config.h.

	Fixed m_trace() so that it now reports correct idletimes and added
	WINTRHAWK styling option.

	Updated opers.txt with mod1 commands.

	Added a ChangeLog |8^)

	Added some code for K-line files but it's not yet functional
