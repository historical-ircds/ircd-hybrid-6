ircd-hybrid-6 INSTALL
---------------------
$Id$

As of hybrid-4, the distribution uses gnu autoconf instead of the old
Config script. 

0.  Read the RELNOTES and ChangeLog files to find out about the
exciting new features in this version.  Changes to ircd.conf are
documented in doc/example.conf.

1.  Run the configure script.  It will create include/setup.h and the
Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure

2.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to change
various options of how the ircd will operate.  Notes: "HARD_FDLIMIT_"
and "INIT_MAXCLIENTS" must be less than the maximum file descriptors
per process allowed by your kernel, and must be <= FD_SETSIZE (usually
defined in system includes, but may need to overridden in the Makefile.
Note that the old OS definitions are gone, autoconf handles this now.
Finally set the various PATHs to where you are going to install the ircd.
Do not install the ircd to "."--the install script is not designed to
install ircd properly on top of the existing source tree.

3.  "make" should build ircd.

4.  "make install" to install the server and tools in the path defined
in config.h.
