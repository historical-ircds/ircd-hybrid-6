ircd-hybrid-6 INSTALL
---------------------
$Id$

hybrid-6 relies upon GNU autoconf.  The following is a transcript of
recommended procedures that users/administrators of hybrid-6 should
follow when building and tuning the daemon:

1.  MOST IMPORTANTLY:  Please read "RELNOTES" and "ChangeLog" to get
    an idea of what bugs were fixed, features were added, or variables
    were changed.  Changes to ircd.conf are documented in doc/example.conf.

    If you are upgrading from Hybrid6.0 or earlier, you MUST read
    README.HYBRID6.2-CHANGES

2.  Run the "configure" script.  It will create "include/setup.h" and the
    Makefiles to match your system:

      ./configure

3.  Edit the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to change
    various options of how the ircd will operate.  Please make note of
    the following variables in "include/config.h", as they are common
    fault points for administrators who are learning how to tune their
    daemon:

      HARD_FDLIMIT_
      INIT_MAXCLIENTS

    These two variables **MUST BE LESS** than the maximum number of
    file descriptors **PER PROCESS** permitted by your kernel, and MUST
    be <= FD_SETSIZE (usually defined in system includes, but may need to
    be override by editing the Makefile).  Each operating system handles
    the descriptor definitions differently; in the case of FreeBSD, please
    use sysctl(8) to check the following MIBs for their values:

      kern.maxfiles
      kern.maxfilesperproc

    Please remember that when starting the daemon, that shell limits
    may be imposed.  Check these by becoming the user who the daemon runs
    as, and depending upon your shell, use "limit" or "ulimit -a" to check
    what values are currently imposed.  For "limit," look at the number
    after the "descriptor" description.  For "ulimit -a," look at the
    number after the "open files" description.  Understand that this is
    the MAXIMUM number of descriptors (sockets AND open files) which
    that user can have.  If you believe your daemon is experiencing this
    (high CPU usage is usually a sign), try using utilities like "ktrace"
    or "truss" on the running ircd process to find out what troubles it
    might be having.

    Note that the old OS definitions are gone; autoconf handles this.

    Finally, set the various PATHs to where you are going to install the
    ircd.  Do NOT install the ircd to "." -- the install script is not
    designed to install ircd properly on top of the existing source tree.
    Doing this will in turn make quite a mess.

4.  "make" should build ircd.

5.  "make install" to install the server and tools in the path defined
    in config.h (DPATH).


HOW TO GET HELP:
----------------
Send Check or Money Order to...  just kidding!  Commercial support for
ircd-hybrid is not available at this time.

However, all hope is not lost; the Hybrid Mailing List is available for
general help, and/or questions.  To subscribe, please send Email to
listmanager@the-project.org with a single line in the body containing
"subscribe hybrid".

If hybrid crashes on you, PLEASE CONTACT ircd-hybrid@the-project.org
ASAP with a backtrace of the core.  The hybrid team can't fix bugs if
no one tells us about them!

If there is a new feature you would like to see in the next major
release of ircd-hybrid, please post it to the public mailing list,
hybrid@the-project.org.
