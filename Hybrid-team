  The hybrid team is a group of ircd coders who were frustrated
with the instability and all-out "dirtiness" of the efnet ircd's
available. "hybrid" is the name for the collective efforts of a group
of people, all of us.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to this effort. We are serious about this.

  We have run the code through "purify", a commercial program designed
to find memory leaks. It continues to be checked with malloc tools today.
The code has been prototyped. Profiling has also been done to catch 
slow portions of the code. "crufty" code has been re-written, obsolete
code has been ripped out. We have also looked at making the code as easy
to setup up and run as possible using configure etc. 
Finally speed enhancements and other enhancements have been made to this ircd,
and continue to be made to this ircd. 

 That is not to say that there are still not bugs, There are always bugs.
But we review each others work on this project, and are open
to bug reports.
