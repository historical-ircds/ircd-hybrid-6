  CONNECT       - CONNECT <server_A> [port] [server_B]
                  When [server_B] is used, CONNECT asks [server_B] to
                  connect to <server_A>.  Global Opers only.

                  When [server_B] is not used, CONNECT trys to connect
                  your server to <server_A>.  Local and Global Opers.

                  When [port] is used, the connection will be attempted
                  to [port].
                  When [port] is not used, 6667 is used as a default.

+ WALLOPS       - WALLOPS :<message>
                  Sends a WALLOPS message of <message> to all opers
                  who are umode +w and +z (see above)

  TRACE         - TRACE [server|nick]
                  TRACE shows client info about [server|nick] or about
                  the server you are on if no [server|nick] is given.

                  All users that use TRACE can see the path to
                  [server|nick] if given and all servers and opers
                  connected, as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

                  Opers can see all clients connected to a server
                  with TRACE as well as the connection class they
                  fall into.

  REHASH        - REHASH [option]
                  When no [option] is given, ircd will re-read the
                  ircd.conf file.

                  [option] can be one of the following:
                    DNS     - Re-read the /etc/resolv.conf file
                    IP      - Reloads the IP hash for the new and
                              improved ACKPATCH.  Should never need 
                              to be used.
                    TKLINES - Clears temporary klines
                    GLINES  - Clears G lines
                    GC      - Performs garbage collecting of excess
                              memory.
                    MOTD    - Re-reads MOTD file
                    HELP    - Re-reads this HELP file
                    DLINES  - Re-hashes D-lines

  CLOSE         - CLOSE
                  Close any connections from clients who have not fully
                  registered yet.

  DIE           - DIE [reason]
                  Terminates the IRC server with optional reason 
                  [reason]

+ HASH          - HASH
                  Shows some stats about ircd's internal hashes.

+ DNS           - DNS
                  Shows some stats about ircd's asynchronous resolving
                  code

+ KLINE         - KLINE <nick|user@host> :[reason]
                  Adds a KLINE to the ircd.conf or klines.conf file which
                  will ban the specified user from using that server.
                  The banned client will receive a message saying he/she
                  is banned with reason [reason]

                  KLINE user@ip.ip.ip.ip :[reason]
                  will kline the user at the unresolved ip.
                  ip.ip.ip.ip can be in CIDR form i.e. 192.168.0.0/24
                  or 192.168.0.* (which is converted to CIDR form internally)

                  For a temporary KLINE, length of kline is given in
                  minutes as the first parameter i.e.
                  KLINE 10 <nick|user@host> :cool off for 10 minutes

+ UNKLINE       - UNKLINE <user@host>
                  -- If compiled with UNKLINE --
                  Will attempt to unkline the given <user@host>
                  Will unkline a temporary kline.

+ DLINE         - DLINE <nick|ip> :[reason]
                  Adds a DLINE to the ircd.conf or klines.conf file
                  which will deny any connections from the IP address
                  of the banned client.  The banned client will receive
                  a message saying he/she is banned with reason [reason]

                  In order to use <nick> rather than <ip>, <nick> must
                  be on your server.

+ HTM           - HTM [option]
                  When no [option] is given, HTM shows the current 
                  High Traffic Mode rate and whether HTM is on or off.

                  [option] can be one of the following:
                    ON        - Forces High Traffic Mode to be on.  With
                                this on, ircd is more efficient in
                                reading server-to-server traffic and
                                oper traffic, but will be less efficient
                                than normal with normal client traffic.
                    OFF       - Forces High Traffic Mode to be off.
                                (see above)
                    TO <rate> - Sets the High Traffic Mode rate to
                                <rate>.  Ircd will automatically go
                                into High Traffic Mode when <rate>
                                is reached, and will automatically turn
                                it off when things calm down.
                    QUIET     - When set, ircd will not notify opers
                                when it goes into and out of High
                                Traffic Mode.
                    NOISY     - When set, ircd will notify opers
                                when it goes into and out of High
                                Traffic Mode.
+ SET           - SET <option> <value>
                  <option> can be one of the following:
                    MAX       - Sets the number of max connections
                                to <value>.  (This number cannot exceed
                                HARD_FDLIMIT in config.h)

                    -- The following three are if compiled with FLUD --
                     FLUDNUM   - Sets the number of flud messages to 
                                 trip flud alarm to <value>
                     FLUDTIME  - Sets the number of seconds in which 
                                  FLUDNUM msgs must occur to <value>
                     FLUDBLOCK - Sets the number of seconds to block 
                                 fluds to <value>

                    -- The following is if compiled with NO_CHANOPS_ON_SPLIT
                       or NO_JOIN_ON_SPLIT or PRESERVE_CHANNEL_ON_SPLIT
                     SPLITDELAY - Sets how long after the connect burst
                                  starts before ops can be hacked on new
                                  channels. 5(minutes) is usually plenty.
                                  Disable using 0.

                     SMALLNET   - Below this number of servers present
                                  means special split handling is now on.

                     -- The following is if compiled with ANTI_SPAMBOT
                      SPAMNUM   - Sets how many join/parts to channels
                                  constitutes a possible spambot.
                      SPAMTIME  - Below this time on a channel
                                  counts as a join/part as above.

                     -- The follow is if compiled with ANTI_SPAMBOT_EXTRA
                      SPAMMSGS  - Sets how many messages to different
                                  targets not to a channel will trigger
                                  a possible spambot warning.
                                  Disable using 0.
+ GLINE         - GLINE <user@host> :[reason]
                   -- if compiled with GLINE --
                   Attempts to add a global IRC-network wide ban on
                   <user@host> for the reason [reason].

                   It takes three different opers on three different 
                   servers to do the same GLINE within a short interval,
                   to have a GLINE triggered for a compiled time of hours.
