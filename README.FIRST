If you don't read this first, we won't help you.
:-)

See the INSTALL document for info on configuring and compiling
ircd-hybrid.

IMPORTANT. I/K line handling has changed significantly.  There are also
many new types of conf lines.  Please see RELNOTES and doc/example.conf
for more information.  The default port is no longer specified in the M
line, you must add a specific P line for it.

TRANSLATION: You *MUST* fix your conf before upgrading from hybrid-5.

LOTS OF THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN CONFIG.H.  PLEASE READ THROUGH IT.

There is now a mailing list for general discussion of Hybrid.  To subscribe
to the Hybrid List, send email to listmanager@the-project.org with
a single line in the body containing "subscribe hybrid".

SOLARIS USERS: this code appears to tickle a bug in older gcc and
egcs ONLY on 64-bit Solaris7.  gcc-2.95 and SunPro C on 64bit should
work fine, and any gcc or SunPro compiler on 32bit.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS: this code should compile without any warnings
on FreeBSD 3.x/4.x, RedHat 6.1/7.1, and Solaris 8/sparc.  Please let us know
if you find otherwise.  It probably does not compile on AIX, Cygwin, IRIX,
or libc5 Linux.
