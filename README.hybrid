-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+hybrid-2 (4/12/97):
This is ircd2.8/th.v5a.3 with the WHO, WHOWAS, and IsMember() code
from Comstud's irc2.8.21CSr29.  Please send email to Jon Lusky
<irc@vol.com> if you find problems with it.

Relevant excerpt from irc2.8.21+CSr29/README.CS:
3) /whowas code totally rewritten.  This code is better than Avalon's
   ever was.  You can now raise NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH in config.h to
   a value that makes sense with today's number of clients.  Without
   rewriting, you could expect server lockup, mostly during splits.
   These changes should lower CPU usage quite a bit, especially during
   splits.
4) /who code tweaked.  IsMember() = CPU hog...IsMember() has been changed
   and m_who does less find_user_link()s now...much less.  This is
   a big reducer of CPU usage.  Also another "bug" was removed from
   m_who that can possibly cause server lockups.  The possibility still
   remains, though...not sure how to improve it further without totally
   breaking /who.
5) This goes with #4, but...
   /who nickname was optimized tremendously.  However, this breaks /who
   if you do /who username and username happens to match a nickname.
   Oh well...too bad.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
+hybrid-1 never really existed
