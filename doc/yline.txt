# Y lines define the classes that are used in C, N, I, and O lines
# NOTE:  The sendQ values provided here are for smaller networks.
#        You MUST increase them on a large network

# for servers:
# Y:class number:ping timing:connection frequency:maximum links:sendQ length
# the ping timing MUST be the same on both sides of a server link
# If splits happen even when there is little lag, increase the sendQ

# for clients:
# Y:class number:ping timing:clone:maximum users in this class:sendQ length
# The "frequency field" determins how many users from the same IP are allowed
# on the server, therefore limiting clones.  Leave it blank or set it to
# 0 to disable this restriction
# NOTE that on some ircd's, the match is on the user@host and not the IP
# address.  (Also note that non-idented users from the same IP count as
# clones)
# If the client has problems with ping timeouts, increase the ping timing
# If the client likes to flood, reduce their sendQ
# The best option in all these cases is to create special classes with 
# I: lines to force them into the class
# NEVER define a class less than 0 and avoid defining a class of 0
# RECOMMENDED (IMHO REQUIRED) (The ircd defines class 0, which is VERY
#             restrictive.  By defining Y lines, you open the server up)

# Class 1 is used for normal users, sets a max of 100 and a ping time of 
# 90 seconds, and a sendQ of 100,000 bytes, meaning they can have 100,000
# bytes of data in their sendQ before being disconnected.
# The user will also only be allowed to have 4 connections from the host
Y:1:90:4:100:100000

# Class 2 is the default server class, sets a ping time of 90 seconds and
# a max sendQ of 600,000 bytes.  If the C line for a server is an 
# auto-connecting C line (described below), then it will attempt to connect
# every 300 seconds.  The 20 means that only 20 server links are permitted
Y:2:90:300:20:600000

# Class 100 is for Opers.  Opers should be in a different class so that they 
# are not subject to normal user's limits and can have higher sendQ and ping
# timings if desired
Y:100:90:0:20:100000

# This is an example of a "lagged user" connection line.  Anyone set to use 
# this class will have a higher ping timing and sendQ so that they MIGHT be
# disconnected less often.  Limit the number of users as they should use
# a server that is closer to them
Y:5:180:4:20:200000

# This is an example of a "bad boy (or girl)" class.  Anyone set to this 
# class will have less sendQ to prevent flooding and only be permitted to 
# have 2 connections to the irc server.  Only allow 10 "bad guys/gals" on
# at once.
Y:20:90:2:10:50000

# This is an example of a "privilaged user" class, who is permitted to have
# many more connections, more sendQ, and a longer ping timing
Y:50:120:0:50:300000

# This example is for a "preferred server" described below in the C/N
# Lines.  Autoconnecting C lines will choose the highest numbered class first
Y:3:90:300:20:600000

# Leaf servers should only connect to one server at a time
# Setting the maximum to 1 will prevent the leaf server from attempting
# to establish a connection with more than one server at once
Y:4:90:300:1:600000

# Thus we have class 1 for normal users, 2, 3 and 4 for servers, 100 for opers
# 5 for "lagged users", 20 for "bad boys/girls", and 50 for privilaged users

# Note that we set the oper class to the highest number.  When you sucessfully
# issue the OPER command, you will be placed into the oper class only if it is
# a higher class number than the class the user is currently in.  We may also
# wish to reorganize the numbers of the other user classes so that they are 
# numbered in order from the lowest privilage to the highest.

# Also note that the IRCD type used has an influence on what limits you set.
# Most IRCD's have the limit apply per I: line.  Hybrid and Bahamut with the
# OLD_Y_LIMIT #undef'ed will set the limits in the Y line.  According to the
# information available for those options, closed I: line servers will benefit
# more from the old behavior, while more open servers benefit from the new
# bahavior.  Consult your config.h for more details.  

# A problem I have seen lately is when people set the class in the O: lines
# to 0 or to an invalid class (which will default to 0).  The issue was that
# the user could only OPER once from the same mask.  By making sure all 
# C/N/O/I lines point to valid, properly configured classes, you will prevent
# many issues with the server.
