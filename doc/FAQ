These are the two most frequently asked questions about IRC server
compliation:

* I compile and everything seems fine during the compiling, but when it
comes time for the program to link, I get errors complaining about dns and
res things. What causes this?

You need to make sure IRCDLIBS in the toplevel Makefile includes -lresolv


* I start the ircd program and I get an error about chdir, no such file or
directory. What causes this?

Make sure IRCDDIR in the toplevel Makefile is set to the same as DPATH in
include/config.h
